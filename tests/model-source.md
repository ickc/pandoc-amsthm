::: {.Theorem info="within parenthesis"}
plain theoremstyle *here*
:::

::: {#simplestEquation .Theorem}
Label and reference:

$$E=mc^2$$
:::

From the \ref{simplestEquation}, we see that...

Or we can use pandoc-crossref style [@simplestEquation] as well.

::: {.With_Space info="**This** is *markdown*."}
Environment name has a space, and is unnumbered.
:::

::: {.Lemma info="can cite \ref{simplestEquation}"}
This one share counter with Theorem.

Cite inside info only works with `ref{...}` syntax.
As the conversion using `[@...]` to AST and walk and back to LaTeX would be too complex.
