::: {.Theorem info="within parenthesis"}
plain theoremstyle *here*

We can use pandoc-crossref style @simplestEquation and [@simplestEquation]
and cite before definition.
:::

::: {#simplestEquation .Theorem}
Label and reference:

$$E=mc^2$$

From the \ref{simplestEquation}, we see that...
Or \eqref{simplestEquation}, ...
