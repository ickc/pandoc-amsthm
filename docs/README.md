# Introduction

amsthm provide a syntax to use amsthm environments in pandoc, with output in LaTeX and HTML.

# LaTeX output

Test with this:

```bash
pandoc --top-level-division=chapter tests/model-source.md -F ./amsthm.py -o tests/model-source.pdf
```

# Model

- `model-source.md`: the syntax
- `model-latex.tex`: the output the filter should output from `model-source.md`, when the output format is LaTeX
- `model-target.md`: the output the filter should output from `model-source.md`, when the output format is not LaTeX

# Todo

- [x] YAML syntax and parsing
- amsthm-style
	- [x] LaTeX template into metadata
		- header level maps to LaTeX's parent counter
		- need to aware of `--top-level-division=[section|chapter|part]`: [it will be a tough problem](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pandoc-discuss/pcPD5JthnWQ/5ENi-dGVCwAJ)
	- counter for non-LaTeX output
		- how to make sure the numbering coincide with the one generated by `pandoc -N`? (need to replicate the pandoc's numbering output)
	- style
		- how to emphasize a whole block?

# Tips

Use `-N`, `--number-sections` to enable numbering in pandoc.
