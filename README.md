Complete rewrite:

# Model

- `model-source.md`: the syntax
- `model-latex.tex`: the output the filter should output from `model-source.md`, when the output format is LaTeX
- `model-target.md`: the output the filter should output from `model-source.md`, when the output format is not LaTeX

# Todo

- YAML syntax and parsing
- amsthm-style
	- LaTeX template into metadata
		- header level maps to LaTeX's parent counter
		- need to aware of `--top-level-division=[section|chapter|part]`
	- counter for non-LaTeX output
		- how to make sure the numbering coincide with the one generated by `pandoc -N`? (need to replicate the pandoc's numbering output)
