- YAML syntax and parsing
- amsthm-style
	- LaTeX template into metadata
		- header level maps to LaTeX's parent counter
		- need to aware of `--top-level-division=[section|chapter|part]`
	- counter for non-LaTeX output
		- how to make sure the numbering coincide with the one generated by `pandoc -N`? (need to replicate the pandoc's numbering output)
